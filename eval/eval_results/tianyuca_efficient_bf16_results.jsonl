It has a high melting point and is commonly used as a seasoning and preservative in food. Sodium chloride is composed of sodium (Na\u207a) and chloride (Cl\u207b) ions, forming an ionic crystal lattice. It has a density of approximately 2.16 g/cm\u00b3 and a molecular weight of 58.44 g/mol.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Potential Hazards\n\nSodium chloride is generally considered non-toxic and not hazardous under normal conditions. However, it can cause **irritation** to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system if inhaled in large quantities or in concentrated forms. Ingestion of large amounts may lead to **dehydration** and **electrolyte imbalance**, particularly in individuals with pre-existing health conditions. Sodium chloride is not flammable and does not react with water under normal circumstances.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Handling and Storage Procedures\n\nSodium chloride should be handled in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhalation of fine particles. It should be stored in a **dry**, **cool**, and **sealed** container to prevent moisture absorption, which can lead to clumping or degradation. Avoid direct contact with skin and eyes during handling. When working with large quantities, use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and safety goggles. Ensure that the storage area is away from incompatible materials, although sodium chloride is generally compatible with most substances.\n\n---\n\n### 4) First-Aid Measures\n\n- **In case of eye contact**: Rinse the affected eye with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Seek medical attention if irritation persists.\n- **In case of skin contact**: Wash the affected area with soap and water. Remove contaminated clothing if necessary.\n- **In case of inhalation**: Move to an area with fresh air. If breathing is difficult, seek medical help.\n- **In case of ingestion**: Do not induce vomiting.

For example, an **oblique triangle** is a triangle that does not have a right angle.\n\nIn **navigation**, **\"oblique\"** can describe a course that is not directly towards or away from a point, but at an angle.\n\nIn **language**, **\"oblique\"** can also describe a form of a word that is not the nominative or accusative case, but rather a case used for various grammatical functions, such as the genitive or dative.\n\n### Modern Usage\n\nToday, **\"oblique\"** is used in a variety of contexts, including:\n\n- **Geometry and Mathematics**: Referring to lines, angles, or shapes that are not straight or perpendicular.\n- **Language and Grammar**: Referring to oblique cases in certain languages.\n- **General Usage**: Meaning indirect, slanting, or not straightforward.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Etymology**: Latin *obliquus* (\"slanting\")\n- **Old French**: *oblique*\n- **Middle English**: Adopted into English\n- **Meaning**: Slanting, indirect, not straight\n- **Usage**: Geometry, grammar, and general language\n\nThe word", "gold_answer": null, "score": 0.5, "eval_details": {"question_results": [true, false], "valid_count": 2, "total_questions": 2}}

Close your eyes or keep them half-open if that feels more natural.\n\n2. **Focus on Your Breath:**  \n   Take a few deep, slow breaths. Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 2 counts, and exhale through your mouth for 6 counts. Repeat this for a few cycles to begin centering yourself.\n\n3. **Imagine an Anchor:**  \n   Visualize an anchor in your mind. It could be a physical object you associate with calm (like a seashell, a stone, or a piece of jewelry), or it could be a metaphorical anchor (like a tree, a mountain, or a strong, steady person). This anchor represents stability and calm.\n\n4. **Place the Anchor in Your Mind:**  \n   Picture the anchor in your chest or at your heart. Imagine it anchoring you to the present moment and pulling you away from anxious thoughts. As you breathe in, imagine the anchor growing stronger and more grounded. As you breathe out, imagine any tension or worry being released with your breath.\n\n5. **Engage the Senses:**  \n   Bring your awareness to your surroundings. What do you hear? What do you feel? What do you see? This helps shift your focus from anxious thoughts to the present moment, reinforcing the sense of safety and stability.\n\n6. **Stay Connected to the Anchor:**  \n   Keep the image of the anchor in your mind for a few minutes. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to the anchor and your breath. This is a practice, and it\u2019s okay if your mind drifts.\n\n7. **End with Gratitude:**  \n   When you\u2019re ready, take a few more deep breaths. Gently open your eyes and take a moment to notice how you feel. Reflect on the anchor and the calm it brought you.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works:**\n\n- **Grounding Technique:**  \n  This exercise uses grounding to help individuals stay present.

The son of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington, he was raised in a prominent but modest colonial family. His early years were marked by a strong work ethic and a deep connection to the land, which he inherited from his father. Washington\u2019s education was limited, but he was tutored in subjects like mathematics, geography, and history. He also developed a keen interest in surveying and military tactics, which would later shape his career. Though he had a relatively uneventful childhood, his relationship with his half-brother Lawrence Washington played a significant role in shaping his character and ambitions. Lawrence, who served in the British military, introduced George to the world of military discipline and leadership, laying the foundation for his future role as a revolutionary leader.\n\n**Revolutionary War Leadership**  \nWashington\u2019s leadership during the American Revolutionary War was profoundly influenced by his relationship with Alexander Hamilton, who would later become one of his most trusted advisors. Their bond began in 1775, when Hamilton, a young and ambitious aide-de-camp, joined Washington\u2019s Continental Army. Hamilton\u2019s strategic mind and unwavering loyalty helped Washington navigate the challenges of war, from the disastrous defeat at Long Island to the eventual victory at Yorktown. Washington recognized Hamilton\u2019s potential and gave him opportunities to shape military strategy, which in turn strengthened their mutual respect. This partnership not only bolstered Washington\u2019s leadership but also forged a lasting friendship that would influence the early years of the United States.\n\n**Presidency**  \nWashington\u2019s presidency was marked by a commitment to national unity and the establishment of strong federal institutions. His relationship with Thomas Jefferson, who served as his Secretary of State, played a crucial role in shaping his administration. Jefferson, a leading figure of the Democratic-Republican Party, provided Washington with valuable political insight and helped navigate the complex challenges of governing a new nation. While their political views often diverged, Washington valued Jefferson\u2019s intellect and integrity, and their collaboration helped lay the groundwork for the nation\u2019s future.

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!
