Let's break down its origins and evolution:\n\n### 1. **Latin Roots**\nThe word **\"oblique\"** comes from the **Latin** word **\"obliquus\"**, which means \"slanting\" or \"inclined.\" The root **\"ob-\"** in Latin is a prefix meaning \"against\" or \"away from,\" and **\"clinare\"** is the verb root meaning \"to incline\" or \"to bend.\" Together, **\"obliquus\"** literally means \"inclined away from something,\" or \"not straight.\"\n\n### 2. **Middle English and Old French Influence**\nThe word entered **Middle English** through **Old French**, where it was spelled **\"oblique\"**. The Old French form **\"oblique\"** was used to describe something that was **not direct** or **indirect**, particularly in the context of **geometry** and **direction**.\n\n### 3. **Usage in Geometry**\nIn the **16th century**, the word began to be used more formally in **mathematical and scientific contexts**. In **geometry**, an **oblique** line is one that is **not perpendicular** or **not parallel** to a given line \u2014 in other words, it is **slanted** or **angled**. This usage reflects the idea of something that is **not straight** or **not direct**.\n\n### 4. **Modern Usage**\nToday, **\"oblique\"** is used in a variety of contexts:\n- **Geometry**: As described above.\n- **Language**: To describe something that is **indirect**, **ambiguous**, or **not straightforward**. For example, an **oblique reference** is one that is **not directly stated**.\n- **Law**: In legal contexts, an **oblique** argument is one that is **not directly addressing** the issue at hand.\n- **Literature**: An **oblique** metaphor is one that is **not literal** or **not direct**, often implying **subtlety** or **symbolism**.\n\n### 5. **Synonyms and Related Words**\n- **Indirect**\n- **Ambiguous**\n- **Subtle**\n- **Circumlocutory**\n- **Roundabout**\n\n### 6. **Summary of Etymology**\n| **Word**      | **Origin**        | **", "gold_answer": null, "score": 0.5, "eval_details": {"question_results": [true, false], "valid_count": 2, "total_questions": 2}}

This hole will be used to insert the tube for steam to escape and drive the wheel.\n- **Insert the tube** into the hole and secure it with hot glue or tape. Make sure the tube is tightly sealed to prevent leaks.\n\n### **Step 2: Attach the Wheel**\n- **Mount the wheel** (from a CD or similar material) on a wooden dowel or axle.\n- **Attach the axle** to a small piece of cardboard or a wooden base, ensuring it can rotate freely.\n- **Connect the wheel** to the can using a string or rope. The string should be attached to the top of the can and the bottom of the wheel, so that when steam is released, it pulls the string and turns the wheel.\n\n### **Step 3: Create the Steam Path**\n- **Attach the PVC tube**", "gold_answer": null, "score": 0.6666666666666666, "eval_details": {"question_results": [true, false, true], "valid_count": 3, "total_questions": 3}}

Child Custody and Visitation Rights**\n\n**Primary Custody:**  \nJane Smith shall be designated as the primary custodian of the child. This decision is based on the following considerations:\n\n- **Age of the Child (Supporting Jane):** The child is 13 years old, an age at which emotional and psychological development is critical. Jane has been the primary caregiver since the child's birth, and this role has been consistent with the child's well-being and development.  \n- **Education Level of Each Parent (Supporting Jane):** Jane holds a Master\u2019s degree in Education, which has equipped her with the knowledge and skills to effectively support the child\u2019s academic and emotional growth. John holds a high school diploma, which, while valuable, does not align with the child\u2019s educational needs as closely as Jane's expertise.  \n- **Future Earning Capacities of Each Parent (Supporting Jane):** Jane has a stable and growing career in education, with opportunities for advancement and a consistent income. John\u2019s employment history has been less stable, with periods of unemployment and underemployment. Jane\u2019s future earning capacity is more secure, which supports her ability to provide long-term stability for the child.\n\n**Visitation Rights:**  \nJohn Smith shall have visitation rights with the child on weekends and during school holidays. He shall also have the right to attend school events and participate in the child\u2019s extracurricular activities. Visitation shall be arranged in a manner that is mutually agreeable and beneficial to the child\u2019s well-being.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Child Support Arrangements**\n\n**Child Support Payments:**  \nJohn Smith shall pay child support to Jane Smith in the amount of $1,500 per month, beginning on the first day of the month following the effective date of this agreement. These payments shall continue until the child reaches the age of 18 or completes high school, whichever occurs first.  \n**Child Support Calculation:**  \nChild support shall be calculated based on each parent\u2019s income, the child\u2019s needs, and the standard of living the child enjoyed during the marriage.

It encourages mindfulness and emotional regulation, which are key in reducing the intensity of anxiety.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Practice: \"The Anchor of Calm\"**\n\n**Step 1: Find a Quiet Space**  \nChoose a quiet and comfortable place where you won\u2019t be disturbed. Sit or lie down in a relaxed position. You can close your eyes or keep them slightly open, whichever feels more natural.\n\n**Step 2: Focus on Your Breath**  \nTake a few deep breaths, inhaling slowly through your nose and exhaling gently through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of your breath \u2014 the cool air entering your body, the warmth of your lungs as you exhale.\n\n**Step 3: Imagine an Anchor**  \nVisualize a strong, solid object \u2014 like an anchor \u2014 in your mind. It can be made of any material you like \u2014 metal, wood, stone, or even something symbolic, like a tree or a stone. Picture it as heavy, stable, and rooted firmly in the ground.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Anchor to Your Breath**  \nAs you continue to breathe, imagine that each breath you take is connecting you to this anchor. With every inhale, you\u2019re drawing strength from the anchor. With every exhale, you\u2019re releasing the anxiety or worry you\u2019re holding onto, like a heavy weight being lifted.\n\n**Step 5: Stay with the Anchor**  \nKeep your attention on the anchor and your breath. If your mind starts to wander or anxiety returns, gently bring your focus back to the anchor. Imagine it as a safe place that you can return to whenever you feel overwhelmed.\n\n**Step 6: Return to the Moment**  \nAfter a few minutes, slowly bring your awareness back to your surroundings. If you're sitting, gently move your arms and legs. Open your eyes if you closed them. Take a moment to notice how you feel \u2014 calmer, more centered, and more grounded.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\nThis exercise works by engaging the **mind-body connection** and utilizing **mindfulness techniques** to shift focus from anxiety-provoking thoughts to a grounding image. Here's how it supports anxiety management:\n\n1. **Reduces Rumination:** Anxiety often involves a cycle of worrying thoughts.

Their relationship underscored the importance of resilience and mutual respect in both personal and public life.\n\n**Presidency**  \nAs the first president of the United States, Washington faced the monumental task of establishing a new nation\u2019s government. His presidency was guided by the principles of unity, stability, and the rule of law, which were deeply influenced by his earlier experiences, including his relationship with Martha. Washington\u2019s personal life during this period was marked by a balance between public service and private reflection. He often turned to his wife for emotional support, recognizing that his decisions as president had profound implications for the nation\u2019s future.

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!
